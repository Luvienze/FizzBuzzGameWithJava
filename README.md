# FizzBuzzGameWithJava
I build a Fizz Buzz game in Java. I'm going to update this repo while 'im learning new things in Java.
This is a base build of Fizz Buzz Game. I'll be adding user interaction, player numbers which given by user etc.

//UPDATE//
I coded a new version of fizz buzz game. It has some issues: 
Issue1: cannaot add any number of players, i'll add a array which can create any number of player but i'll be limited it because of the game rule.
Issue2: I couldn't match int to string like it count to 100 and get answer from user but cannot match to string aswer to fizz buzz's numbers. I'll fix it.

//Comparison//
With the FizzBuzzV2 I transform basic game to a object oriented code.There are two classes name Player and FizzBuzzV2 and a main method.
Also i match the player to game and game to player (like game has players and players can play the game) same as department, professor etc's relationships in pmy universit repo.
I feel like i'm realizing object oriented programming. I'm going to fix issues and finally i'll be build a fizz buzz game with java;and then i'll update it with framweworks etc.

//Last Version of Fizz Buzz Game //
I looked internet, github repos etc. and decided to finish my Fizz Buzz Game. I couldn' find any person who coded fizz buzz game that i want, also i think that it's unnecessary to do this cause it'a algorithm problem
so solving this problem was a good practice for me.

To sum up, I coded the a object oriented Fizz Buzz Game with Java. In FizzBuzzV2 class we have game's rule, players and size of the game; in Player class we can set names and play the game and the FizzBuzzTest is my main method's class.
We can name the players, set the size of game and it prints the player's name who says fizz, buzz and fizz buzz.
I really enjoyed while coding fizz buzz game. I tried a lot of code examples and learn how not to convert string to int and int to string :D
