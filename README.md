# FizzBuzzGameWithJava
I build a Fizz Buzz game in Java. I'm going to update this repo while 'im learning new things in Java.
This is a base build of Fizz Buzz Game. I'll be adding user interaction, player numbers which given by user etc.

//UPDATE//
I coded a new version of fizz buzz game. It has some issues: 
Issue1: cannaot add any number of players, i'll add a array which can create any number of player but i'll be limited it because of the game rule.
Issue2: I couldn't match int to string like it count to 100 and get answer from user but cannot match to string aswer to fizz buzz's numbers. I'll fix it.

//Comparison//
With the FizzBuzzV2 I transform basic game to a object oriented code.There are two classes name Player and FizzBuzzV2 and a main method.
Also i match the player to game and game to player (like game has players and players can play the game) same as department, professor etc's relationships in pmy universit repo.
I feel like i'm realizing object oriented programming. I'm going to fix issues and finally i'll be build a fizz buzz game with java;and then i'll update it with framweworks etc.
